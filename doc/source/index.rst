######################################################################

<header here>

This package implements spike sorting with the BOTM algorithm. It is intended
provide as a tool for scientists in neuroscience to process time series data.
It can be used to detect and classify action potentials of distinct single
cells in voltage traces.

For further information on the general topic of spike sorting:
:ref:`spike_sorting/index`

For information on the details of the linear filters and the BOTM method:
:ref:``

For pointers how to get started read the :ref:`` section.
