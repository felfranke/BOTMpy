"""implementation of mc filter application with time domain FIR filters

There is a general implementation suitable for larger chunks of data and batch
mode filtering `mcfilter`. Also there is a filtering strategy that implements
a history item for the part of the signal that could not be filtered in case
of chunked continuous data, so that the filter is applied as far as possible
and the relevant part of the signal data thas is needed to process the next
chunk is passed on as the so called history item.

Implementations are given in Python and alternatively as in Cython. On
import the Cython function is being tried to load, on failure the python
version is loaded as a fallback.
