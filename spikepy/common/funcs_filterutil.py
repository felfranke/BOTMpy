    The multiresolution teager energy operator (MTEO) applies TEO operators of
    varying k-values and returns the maximum response TEO for each input
    sample.

    To assure a constant noise power over all kteo channels, we convolve the
    individual kteo responses with a window:
    h_k(i) = hamming(4k+1) / sqrt(3sum(hamming(4k+1)^2) + sum(hamming(4k+1))
    ^2),
    as suggested in Choi et al., 2006.

    :Parameters:
        X : ndarray
            The signal to operate on. ndim=1
        kvalues : list
            List of k-values to run the kteo for. If you want to give a single
            k-value, either use the kteo directly or put it in a list like
            [2].
    :Returns:
        ndarray
            Array of same shape as the input signal, holding the response of
             the
