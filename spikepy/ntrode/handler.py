"""ntrode handler interface

The NTrodeHandler is a compute context container. NTrodes manage instances of
NTrodeHandler and apply their code on the current data. A NTrodeHandler in
this is an sense, abstractly models an algorithm that can be applied to batch
or online data.

The NTrode's memory (NTrode.mem) is used in a read only manner to save
intermediate results from iteration to iteration. NTrodeHandler's bring a
common interface for 1) attaching to a NTrode instance, 2) initialisation of
any members and NTrode-global variables within the namespace of the NTrode
instance it is attached to, and 3) NTrode-state sensitive invocation.
