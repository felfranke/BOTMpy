"""abstract sorting node interface

All sorting algorithm implementations should derive from this interface. The
interface assumes to operate on multichanneled input data that is presented as
numpy.ndarray with samples in the rows and channels in the columns.

The sorter provides for the structure and abstract methods to implement generic
sorting algorithms. To account for a range of different sorting algorithms, as
less assumption as possible are made to the data flow during sorting. The
operation mode of the sorting is assumed to be online in the sense that
arbitrarily small batches of data can be sorted in a sorting step. The sorting
results are presented in a python dictionary with one entry per identified unit,
holding the spiketrain in samples relative to the start of the current data
batch.

    The interface assumes to get data (usually multichanneled timeseries) and a
    set of parameters. It should return a python dictionary, with one entry per
    unit, where the entry is a python dictionary as well. The entry should hold
    the spiketrain of that unit and any parameters learned or updated from the
    spike sorting process. The results should be saved under the self.fout
    member variable, which should hold the sorting of the last data that was
    passed to the node or None in case the node has not seen any data yet.

    Also it should be possible to merge the sorted spike trains for GDF export
    and produce an epochs representation for any part of the sorting and for
    the noise.
